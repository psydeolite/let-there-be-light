Instructions
1. Plug in tie, make sure lights are flashing and on.
2. Unplug all usb devices if possible.
3. Wait a few seconds, the neopixels should turn on and become bright red
4. Type into terminal: ls /dev/tty*
5. You should see a list of serial ports. Find the one which starts with /dev/cu.usbmodem.
If there's more than one, you are probably using more than one usb port. You can either try one port then the other or unplug any other device.
6. Go into Sorts, open the Processing files.
7. Under Driver on the 8th line of code there should be "myPort = new Serial(this, "/dev/cu.usbmodem1421", 9600);"
8. Replace /dev/cu.usbmodem1421 with the port on your computer.
This is necessary because we can't predict which USB port will be used to transmit data between the Arduino and the computer. Plan C is a proof of concept for the sorting, in case the tie malfunctioned.
